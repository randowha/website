Potential future website

Rough idea:
 - one page homepage with scrolling down
   - home (what's going on currently)
   - CV (clean CV with option to export as PDF)
   - contact (mail form, linkedIn, github)

- interests and adventures can be looked at at a separate page (maybe book effect or switching colors to get there)
